Lesson 1
- Part 1
- Part 2
- Part 3: task 1
- Part 4: Solution is reverseHash.py
- Part 5

Lesson 2
- Part 1
- Part 2: AWS price of 1h core = 0.5 cent
2 million hashes per second
200,000 hashes per 1 tenth of a second
Bust 1 word = 1/72,000 of a penny
Bust 2 words = (2*10^5)^2 which is 4*10^(10) divided by 2 million ~ 20,000 seconds ~ 5.5 hours = 2 cents
The number of 3 word combinations gets us to (2*10^5)^3 which is 8*(10^(15)), divided by 2*10^6 we get 4 billion seconds which is about 126 years of computation time. Now core-years are not too expensive actually, since one core-hour is half a penny we can do 200 hours for a dollar and this whole thing costs between 5 and 8 thousand dollars to break. Now four words will be around 5 and a half million, and five words will be around a trillion dollars.
